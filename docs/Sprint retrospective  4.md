## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation?
    We underestimated one story that was more complicated then we expected.
- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
    Free time is very useful because at the end you come back stronger than before.
- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
    We achieved all of them.
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
   
- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them: (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
    Manage all the issues received from the stakeholder and learn something about the telegram bot.
- One thing you are proud of as a Team: We learned the scrum metodology and we think we applied it in the best way we could.
