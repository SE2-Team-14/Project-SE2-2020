### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |    9    |   -    |   50h 30m  |    52h 50m   |
| 6      |    2    |   5    |   6h       |    6h        |
| 7      |    2    |   5    |   3h 15m   |    3h 15m    |
| 8      |    1    |   5    |   30m      |    1h 30m    |
| 9      |    2    |   3    |   2h 45m   |    2h 45m    |

  - Standard Deviation: 3h 18m 

- Total task estimation error ratio: 
    - Total hours estimated: 72h
    - Total hours spent: 75h 15m
        - Total task estimation error ratio: 72/75.25 = 0.99

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation?
We have 3h more with respect to the original estimation but these hours are spread over multiple tasks making the effective time
close to the estimation. In the case of story number 8 maybe our estimation was optimistic because we expected things to work correctly the first time.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
We improved our knowledge about new frameworks, team work and test framework.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
    - We performed a better estimations of the tasks;
    - We increased to three the number of SCRUM meetings per week so we can organize better and perform regularly checks on how the system works.
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them: (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
Improve even more the estimation on tasks.

- One thing you are proud of as a Team:
We are really proud of team work.
