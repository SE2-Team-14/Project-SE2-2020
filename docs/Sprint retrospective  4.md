## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation?
We estimated 10h in code review but at this point of the developement process we found a way to program which is good for everyone so 7h of code review were necessary.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
We have improved our capability to estimate works.
We maybe gave too much importance to the conflicting stakeholders feedback, and that caused unnecassary extra work trying to satisfy everything.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
We improved the estimation of tasks but we overestimated olny the code review time.
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?


- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them: (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
We can improve our stakeholders feedback management, according to what we said above

- One thing you are proud of as a Team:
We are proud of having reached all our improvement goals as a team
