RETROSPECTIVE SPRINT 1 (Team 14)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done: 
    - Stories committed: 5
    - Stories done: 5
- Total points committed vs done:
    - Total points committed: 15 
    - Total points done: 15
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team)
    - Total hours planned: 72h
    - Total hours spent: 72h 18m 

**Remember**  a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing: 48
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |   10    |   -    |   59h 30m  |    58h 48m   |
| 1      |    2    |   5    |   4h       |    4h        |
| 2      |    1    |   3    |   2h       |    1h 40m    |
| 3      |    2    |   2    |   3h 15m   |    4h 20m    |
| 4      |    1    |   3    |   1h 30m   |    1h        |
| 5      |    2    |   2    |   1h 45m   |    2h 30m    |

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation)

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent from previous table

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 
  - Total hours spent
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 
  - Coverage: 69.4%
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent
- Technical Debt management:
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube
  - Hours spent on remediation 
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability")
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability )
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!: WE ARE VERY BEAUTIFUL
